            <p>Hello, I currently am a substite teacher for Morgan Hunter Education Services and respit care provider for the Down Syndrom Guild Community in the Kansas City area.
            I have a Bachelor's degree in Speech Pathology and have been working in the academic environment with students ages 3-14 for 8+ years.</p>

            <p> My wonderful husband, Chad and I are huge gamers. We enjoy board games such as, 7 Wonders, Gloomhaven and Terriforming Mars as well as online games by Blizzard Entertainment.
            I love games so much, I wanted to learn more about making them. So, with no background in technology or coding, I began the KU coding bootcamp to learn more.</p>
       
            <p>I look forward to all the new developer skills I will gain in the program and am ready to put in the hard work.</p>
